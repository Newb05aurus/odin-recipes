    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe for making chicken quesadillas at home. Stop spending so much on Doordash and cook this amazing meal at home!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken. Tender, protein-packed chicken breast (or thighs).</li>
        <li>Cheese. Choose a cheese or a mixture of cheeses. Good options include pepper jack, montery jack, and sharp cheddar.</li>
        <li>Veggies. To make this chicken quesadilla healthy, you can pack it with delicious veggies. Bell peppers and onions are my favorite.</li>
        <li>Spices. Chili powder, salt, and garlic powder add just the right amount of flavor to the quesadilla.</li>
        <li>Tortilla. Choose the kind you like best.</li>
        <li>Toppings. Salsa, guacamole, queso, and sour cream (plain Greek yogurt works well too) are our go-to toppings. You could also add pico de gallo, fresh cilantro, or shredded lettuce.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the chicken to a bowl, then stir in half of the spices.</li>
        <li>Saut√© the vegetables with spices.</li>
        <li>Assemble the quesadillas by piling the fillings onto one half of a tortilla.</li>
        <li>Fold the empty tortilla half over the top. Repeat.</li>
        <li>Cook the quesadillas two at a time in a skillet.</li>
        <li>Flip after about 4 minutes, cooking on the other side for a few minutes. Let cool, slice, and DIG IN!</li>
    </ol>
